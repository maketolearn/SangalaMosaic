# Sangala Mosaic — project guide for Claude Code

A browser tool that turns a photo into a **LEGO-tile mosaic** a person can build by hand on a
baseplate. Import a photo, remove its background, frame it under a grid, and map it to a grid of
1×1 tiles (target 32×32, the standard baseplate) using **only the tile colors the builder actually
owns** — then read off a build chart and a parts list. Built for the same course and the same
schools as Sangala Studio; piloted by Moses Kumenya at Hawthorne-Scribner High School in the
Mt. Elgon region of Uganda, where a student's animal (the buffalo, the crested crane) becomes a
mosaic.

**This is a SEPARATE app from Sangala Studio, deliberately.** It shares the look and feel and can
borrow code, but it lives in its own repo so Sangala Studio does not get overloaded. It may be
folded into Sangala Studio later; for now, keep them apart. The sibling project is
`D:\Code Projects\Silhouette Tools` (Sangala Studio).

## What makes this different from Sangala Studio
- **No bridge.** Sangala Studio carries a C# USB bridge because it drives a die cutter. Sangala
  Mosaic drives nothing — it outputs a chart and a parts list a person builds by hand. So it is a
  **single self-contained HTML file, pure browser, no server, no USB, no install.** Do not add a
  bridge. If a print is ever needed, it prints from the browser.
- Everything else about the environment is inherited from Sangala Studio: **no admin rights, no
  install, works offline.** This constraint is absolute — the schools have no admin access.

## The feature that matters most (do not lose sight of it)
**Build to the tiles you actually have.** A generic photo-to-pixels filter is a toy; what makes
this a build tool is mapping to a chosen SET of real tile colors and telling the builder how many
of each they need.
- Quantize to a palette that IS the builder's inventory, not "reduce to N colors."
- Preload real LEGO 1×1 tile colors (BrickLink RGB values); let the builder check which they own.
- Produce a **bill of materials** — "47 black, 23 white, 8 red…" — and optionally cap a color at
  the number owned, letting the next-nearest available color absorb the overflow.
This is the through-line. Resolution/pixelation sliders and pretty previews are secondary to it.

## Agreed feature plan (2026-07-23, from the design discussion)
Priority order, not a checklist to rush:
1. **Palette-constrained mapping + bill of materials** (above). The centerpiece.
2. **Photo layer** — import .jpg/.png, remove background offline, move/resize/zoom as a floating
   layer under the grid. *Borrowable* from Sangala Studio (see below).
3. **Grid layer** — a W×H grid (default 32×32) slid independently over the photo to set framing;
   physical-size readout (32 × 8 mm ≈ 256 mm ≈ 10 in); optional seams where baseplates meet.
   "Resolution" and "grid size" are the SAME knob here — the baseplate fixes it.
4. **Per-tile manual override** — click a cell, pick a color. Auto never nails eyes/faces (the
   buffalo's eyes were hand-placed). Essential, not optional.
5. **Printable build chart** — coordinates (A1…) and a per-row run-length readout
   ("row 12: 5 black, 3 white, 2 black"), the way mosaic/cross-stitch patterns are followed.
6. **Image prep that earns its place at low resolution** — contrast/levels BEFORE quantizing
   (a photo crushed to ~10 colors goes to mud otherwise); a dither toggle **default OFF** (flat
   blocks — cluster-then-mode — usually beat Floyd–Steinberg under big tiles); background-fill
   color for the removed background (those cells become real tiles).
Deferred/out of scope, on purpose: generic filters (hue/saturation, art effects), any SVG or
print-and-cut export (nothing is cut — tiles are placed), anything 3D. Those belong to Sangala
Studio; pulling them in is the overloading this split is meant to avoid.

## Sharing look and feel with Sangala Studio
- The look is shared by **copying**, not by a live dependency. The CSS classes (`denim`, `cork`,
  `marker`, `header`/`logo`/`tbtn`/`menu`, `stage`/`panel`/`board`, form controls) are lifted from
  `Silhouette Tools/SangalaStudio.html`. When Studio's styling changes, port the change over
  deliberately — there is no automatic link, and that is on purpose (no coupling to break).
- **Stay in sync with Sangala Studio — Glen's directive (2026-07-24): any future look-and-feel change is
  made JOINTLY across BOTH apps; do not let one drift from the other.**
- **About screen** matches Studio: the text is the content of `Documents/Sangala Mosaic.docx` (the About
  document Glen maintains — edit that, then port it in), and it ends with a centered **Version** line
  (`#aboutVersion`) read from the `SANGALA_MOSAIC_VERSION` marker on line 2 (the same value the updater
  compares), exactly like Studio's `aboutVersion`.
- **Desktop launcher:** `Turaco.ico` (repo root — 7 sizes 16→256, built with Pillow from the turaco head
  crop) plus `Create Desktop Shortcut.cmd` make a Desktop shortcut that opens `SangalaMosaic.html` with the
  turaco icon. Ship the `.ico` and `.cmd` alongside the HTML for the launcher to work.
- **Updater:** `Update SangalaMosaic.cmd` — the parallel to Studio's `Update SangalaStudio.cmd`, but simpler
  because Mosaic is a single page (no exe, no engine lock, no `taskkill`). Double-click it: it curls
  `SangalaMosaic.html` from the repo's raw URL, checks it ends in `</html>`, gates on the
  `SANGALA_MOSAIC_VERSION` marker (first `findstr` match = the line-2 comment; the About-JS references come
  later and are ignored), and swaps the page in only when the version differs (keeping a `.bak`). It also
  best-effort fetches `Turaco.ico` if missing and refreshes the Desktop shortcut every run — so running the
  `.cmd` alone bootstraps a full install. The `.cmd` is stable infra: bump `SANGALA_MOSAIC_VERSION` on ANY
  shipped page change or the checker calls it "already up to date".
- **App icon = the turaco** (inline base64 on the About button + favicon). Each Sangala app has its
  OWN Mt. Elgon species icon (Studio keeps the buffalo, Mosaic gets the turaco — a colorful,
  uniquely-African bird); see [[app-icon-scheme]]. Source is `images/Turaco (Ver 3,0).png` (Glen's
  Nano Banana render, background smoothed to blue in Fireworks, facing left); the glyph is the
  **head-and-body crop**, square, generated by the wire script and kept inline (single-file rule
  holds). The buffalo base64 has been removed from Mosaic. Convention: the LEGO figure sits on a
  smooth field (buffalo on tan, turaco on blue) — not a studded baseplate.
- Subtitle under the brand is **"Mosaic Design Tool"** — Title Case, every word capitalized
  including "Tool" (Glen confirmed 2026-07-23). Sangala Studio's subtitle was changed to match:
  "Digital Fabrication Tool", also Title Case.

## Borrowable code (copy, do not link)
- **Photo import + background removal + move/resize** already exist in Sangala Studio as the
  `refImg` layer (`SangalaStudio.html`) using `assets/imagetracer_v1.2.6.js`, offline. When we
  build the photo layer, PORT those functions across — copy them, keep this app self-contained.

## Conventions (same house rules as Sangala Studio)
- **American spelling everywhere** — color, center, gray, behavior. US project, US course.
- **All buttons and headings are Title Case** (set by Glen 2026-07-26): "Add Tile Colors in a
  Photo", "Fit to Photo", "Tile List", "Update Mass" — minor words (a, in, to, the) stay
  lowercase. Applies to static labels AND labels set from JS. And no shouting anywhere: never
  ALL-CAPS a word for emphasis in UI text or tooltips ("added", not "ADDED").
- **UI wording must not presume the student's plan — and neither may the docs (Glen, 2026-07-26,
  after the guide shipped "pervaded with this mindset").** A student may design first and buy
  tiles later. The palette is the SET OF COLORS THE MOSAIC USES; matching it to owned tiles is one
  way to use it, never the frame. Palette wording stays neutral ("Adjust colors in the Tile
  Palette", not "change which tile colors you have"); no ownership language outside the Tile
  Colors fold; in the User Guide, no "build to the tiles you own" framing — the parts list is
  "the list to order from or build against."
- **The User Guide is a REFERENCE guide (Glen, 2026-07-26): tools and functionality only,
  completely neutral on pedagogy.** It says what each control is, does, and where it lives — it
  never prescribes a workflow, an order of operations, or "which tools for which task." The
  Design through Making book (Chapter 4 for Mosaic) is the carefully scaffolded teaching sequence;
  a guide that teaches competes with the chapter and will contradict it as the chapter evolves.
  You cannot predict how users will use the app once it leaves your hands — don't try. State
  facts, not advice ("rebuilding resets hand edits", never "so save your hand edits for last").
  No course narrative ("your animal") in the guide.
- **NEVER write "honest", "honestly", "genuinely", or "straightforward"** — anywhere. Say the
  thing plainly. (Glen has had to correct this repeatedly in the sibling project.)
- Be concise and direct; prose over bullet lists unless a list is warranted. Do NOT use popup
  question dialogs — ask inline, one question at a time.
- The mosaic is built from 1×1 **tiles** (square, flat) placed on a baseplate; the **studs** the
  tiles snap onto are round. Do not conflate tiles and studs.
- **One change at a time, then let Glen test, then commit.** Commit after each verified-good state
  so a regression is a `git diff` away.

## Build & run
Single file: open `SangalaMosaic.html` in a browser. No build step, no server. UI-only, so a
change is just a refresh. Version marker on line 2 (`SANGALA_MOSAIC_VERSION`) follows the same
date convention as Sangala Studio; bump it on any shipped change.

## Approval & git
- **Standing approval (same as Sangala Studio):** work confined to THIS repo, the temp scratch
  folder, and pushing commits to this repo's GitHub once a remote exists. No need to ask.
- **Always ask first:** anything outside this repo, system/account settings, creating the GitHub
  remote, and any history-losing git (force-push, hard reset dropping commits, branch deletion).
- Remote is live: **https://github.com/maketolearn/SangalaMosaic** (public, branch `main`;
  transferred from `GlenBull` to the Make to Learn organization on 2026-09-23). Standing
  approval covers pushing to it.

## Publishing to Dropbox — part of committing, not a later step
**WHENEVER A COMMIT IS MADE, THE DROPBOX COPY IS UPDATED TOO (Glen, 2026-09-13: "the standing protocol
is that whenever a commit is made, the dropbox version is also updated").**
**This is a family-wide rule and its authority is the GLOBAL guide** - `C:\Users\glenb\.claude\CLAUDE.md`, section "A push to GitHub is not a delivery. Dropbox is." - because a rule about all three filed under one of them is invisible in the other two. What follows here is the same rule with this application's own paths.
 `AI Sandbox\Design through
Making\Sangala Tools\Sangala Mosaic Files` is what Jo, Moses and the students install from, so a copy
left behind there is the version they actually get. `Update SangalaMosaic.cmd` pulling from GitHub does
NOT excuse it — that serves only a tester who runs the updater. Mosaic sat at `.93` in Dropbox while
this repository moved to `.102` on exactly that mistaken reasoning.

**The tool is `tools\sangala_publish.py` IN THE SILHOUETTE TOOLS REPO** (it covers all three
applications from one place). Report, fix, confirm:

    python "D:\Code Projects\Silhouette Tools	ools\sangala_publish.py"
    python "D:\Code Projects\Silhouette Tools	ools\sangala_publish.py" --publish Mosaic
    python "D:\Code Projects\Silhouette Tools	ools\sangala_publish.py"

**Documents go there too, and without being asked:** a new version of a document about Mosaic is copied
into that same folder and the version it supersedes is moved into the folder's own `Archive`, so the
folder shows only the current version. A document that governs more than one application goes at the TOP
level of `Sangala Tools` instead, where Jo and Moses both read.

## Current state (as of 2026-07-23)
- **Four-region layout** matching Studio: denim menu bar, left tool rail, cork workspace, right
  "Build" control panel. Subtitle "Mosaic Design Tool" (Title Case).
- **The workspace is a free compositor** (`SangalaMosaic.html`, one `<script>` IIFE):
  - `layers[]` — image layers. Each **Open/drop ADDS** an image (mountains behind, a buffalo in
    front = a composite), placed at native size, downscaled only to fit (never upscaled, so it
    stays crisp). Click to select; drag the body to move; drag a corner handle to resize
    (aspect-locked, opposite corner anchored) — Studio's refImg interaction. Delete key removes
    the selected image.
  - `frame` — the **grid region**, a movable/resizable frame (drag its border to move, corner to
    resize; aspect locked to the grid, so cells stay square). It carries the cell lines and the
    coordinate labels (numbers 1..gw across the top, letters A..Z, AA.. down the left, drawn just
    OUTSIDE the frame with a white halo). Changing Across/Down reshapes it. The mosaic will be
    whatever falls inside this frame. The *Show* group's **Grid** checkbox toggles the cells+labels and its
    **Box** checkbox toggles the outline (bounding box); the move/resize hit region (`pick`/`onBorder`) is
    independent of the outline draw, so the frame stays grabbable even with the Box hidden.
  - Rendered at device resolution (`dpr`) for crisp pixels. Canvas fills the board; objects hold
    absolute coords. Layers have a `draw` source separate from `img`, so **Remove background**
    (a per-image toggle in the Selected panel; flood-fill from the corners + feather + decontaminate)
    swaps a transparent version in without losing the original.
- **Build It! is live** (the centerpiece). `PALETTE` is 27 real LEGO solid tile colors, each with
  an `own` flag; the swatch row toggles ownership (click). **Append new tiles at the END only** —
  saved `.mosaic` files index tiles by array position, so inserting/reordering corrupts them. (Grays
  now span White · Very Light Gray `[205,208,206]` · Light Gray `[160,165,169]` · Medium Gray
  `[108,110,104]` · Dark Gray `[89,93,96]` · Black — the light/medium grays were added 2026-07-24 so
  designs like the crane get a real two-tone instead of collapsing to one Light Gray.) The pipeline (toward the "gold standard"
  clean look, per the design discussion): sample the framed composite to an offscreen (smoothing OFF,
  8/cell) → **average** each cell's non-background samples (flattens feather texture) → **k-means to
  K colors** (the `Colors` slider) and snap each group to its nearest OWNED tile (a textured body
  becomes one gray, not five) → **cleanup** (two gentle passes: fill pinholes, drop lone strays,
  recolour outvoted speckle; conservative so 1-tile legs survive). Fills the **bill of materials**
  (counts per colour; total = TILED cells). Options: **Ignore background** (default on — samples a
  `removeBg`-isolated copy per layer so the backdrop is empty and thin parts survive), **Colors**,
  **Clean up**, **Contrast**, **Brightness**; changing any re-maps live once a mosaic exists. The workspace is **modeless** (2026-07-23, at Glen's request — "No Modes"): there is NO `viewMode`
  and NO photo/mosaic/compare switching. One live canvas always shows the photos, the grid on top,
  and — once built — the mosaic drawn *in the grid*. **The mosaic is a snapshot; only Build It!
  (re)makes it**, sampling whatever the grid currently covers. Nothing else discards it: moving or
  resizing the grid or an image, adding / deleting / reordering images, toggling background removal or
  tile ownership all leave the mosaic alone (`invalidate()` is now called only by a grid-size change,
  where the cell count genuinely changes). So the grid, the images, and the mosaic (which rides inside
  the grid, moving with it) are all draggable at all times.
- **No Compare button** (removed 2026-07-23; `drawCompare` / `drawFramedPhoto` deleted). Because the
  workspace stays live after Build, "compare" is just *drag the source photo next to the mosaic* — you
  can add and place images freely after building — which made the dedicated Compare view redundant.
- **Transparent overlay** (menu label **Transparent**; internal id `bSeeThru`, var `seeThrough` —
  renamed from "See-through" 2026-07-23, ids/vars kept). Kept because it is the one thing you can't get
  by arranging objects: it draws the mosaic tiles at `globalAlpha 0.55` over the photo *under the grid*
  (`drawBuilt(frame, true)` — the `noPlate` arg skips the plate — plus the cell lines/labels), so you
  can trace the photo while painting. Toggle off for the solid mosaic.
- **Baseplate render.** The built mosaic sits on a **studded LEGO baseplate**: `getPlate()` draws a
  cached (dpr-scaled) plate of round studs across the frame, and `drawBuilt()` draws each tile
  **raised** above it (bevel highlight/shade + a drop shadow + a thin seam inset), so tiles read as
  placed on the plate; empty cells show the bare plate. The plate color is chosen from `BASEPLATE` —
  **eight colors LEGO actually offers as baseplates** (White default, Green, Gray, Blue, Sand/Tan,
  Black, Red, and **Light Blue** `[159,195,233]` = LEGO Bright Light Blue, added 2026-07-24) via a
  single-select swatch row (`#baseplates`), so the preview stays realistic.
  Visibility of the grid, the plate, and the outline is a **single `Show` control** in the Grid section —
  a `Show` label with three checkboxes, **Grid** (`#ckGrid`, `showGrid`), **Baseplate** (`#ckPlate`,
  `showPlate`) and **Box** (`#ckBox`, `showBox`, the frame outline / bounding box) — so any or all can be
  turned off, right down to a fully clean view (all three off over a photo = tracing view).
  **NUMBER THE TILES IS NOT ONE OF THEM** (`#ckKey`, `showKey`, default OFF, added 2026-09-11 for Natasha
  Heny's portrait: the LEGO colors are hard to tell apart in the hand). It rode in the `Show` row as
  **Key** until 2026-09-13, when Glen said "Key is different from the three options above it; no one would
  know what Key does" - the other three hide or reveal something ALREADY on the mat, this one puts new
  marks on it. So it gets its OWN labeled row - a bold `Key`, then one checkbox, **Number the Tiles** -
  built exactly like the `Show` row and sitting parallel to it, with a sentence under it. The bold word
  names the thing, the checkbox says what turning it on does; do not fold it back into `Show`. It numbers every tile by its color: `keyMap()` assigns 1..N in
  `tileRows()` order - which since .96 runs BY COLOR FAMILY (`colorRank()`: eight hue bins from red, neutrals
  last), light to dark within a family, NOT by count: numbering by count scattered the near-alike browns
  across the key, and the point is to compare neighbors - `drawKey()` prints the number centered on the tile in
  contrasting ink (`keyInk`, by luminance), skipping cells under 8 px, in BOTH `drawBuilt()` (screen) and
  `mosaicImageCanvas()` (Print / Save image). **A number without its legend is a puzzle, not a key** (Glen,
  same day, on seeing numbered tiles and nothing else): `drawLegend()` draws the legend - number, swatch,
  color name, count, in columns as wide as the mosaic, headed "Key - N tiles in M colors" - beneath the
  mosaic on screen (it moves with the frame) and beneath the chart in Save image
  (`mosaicImageCanvas(opaque, legend=true)`, which grows the canvas to hold it). Print does NOT draw it:
  the printed sheet's list (`fillPrintList`, `.plkey`) is the legend there. That list and the Tile List
  .txt ALWAYS carry the number as their first column, whether or not Key is on, so the sheet and the tiles
  agree. Persists in the `.mosaic` file (`showKey`; absent = off). Unchecking
  **Baseplate** hides the plate for a clean chart-style view (tiles on white); when the plate is showing,
  the internal cell lines are suppressed (studs mark the grid) and when it is hidden the cell lines return,
  so empty cells stay legible. Hiding the plate dims the color swatches (nothing to color). `syncShow()`
  reflects `showGrid`/`showPlate`/`showBox`/`showKey` back onto the four checkboxes (used on load and at
  startup); all four persist in the `.mosaic` file. Do NOT reintroduce the old separate `bShowGrid`/`bShowPlate`
  buttons.
- The workspace is **pinned to the viewport** (body flex column, 100vh, overflow hidden); the panel
  scrolls internally if tall — no page scroll.
- **Save + Open** (menu bar, `bSave` / `bOpen`, added 2026-07-24). `saveProject()` serializes the whole
  project to a **self-contained `.mosaic` file** (JSON): the image layers with each photo embedded as a
  PNG data URL (`imgToDataURL` draws `L.img` to a canvas — not tainted, since photos come from blob/data
  URLs), the frame, grid size, the built mosaic (`built` incl. `idx`/`counts`), palette ownership,
  baseplate, show-grid/plate/transparent flags, options, and paint color. **Save uses the SAME method as
  Sangala Studio: `window.showSaveFilePicker` (native Save As — the user picks folder + name), with a
  plain-download fallback only where that API is missing.** Do NOT revert Save to a bare `a.download`; the
  auto-dump to Downloads was a defect Glen flagged ("removing control from the user"). **Clicking Save opens
  a small popup menu (`#saveMenu`, `.popmenu`) with two choices: _Project_ (`.mosaic`, `saveProject()`) and
  _Image_ (`.png` / `.jpg`, `saveImage()`).** _Image_ is disabled until a mosaic is built. `saveImage()`
  renders JUST the mosaic to a fresh offscreen canvas via `mosaicImageCanvas()` (a print-friendly ~1600 px
  max side; reuses `getPlate` and the exact `drawBuilt` tile styling) and writes it through the same
  `showSaveFilePicker`; the picker's type dropdown offers PNG and JPEG and the chosen extension picks the
  encoding. **The picture is a WYSIWYG of the Show checkboxes**, mirroring `render()`/`drawFrame()`: the
  **Baseplate** (if shown, else a **transparent** PNG / white JPEG), the tiles, the cell lines +
  **coordinate labels** when **Grid** is on (numbers across the top, letters down the left, in header-strip
  margins `gT`/`gL` — so a student can print it and build the mosaic from the grid offline; do NOT strip the
  grid back out), and the outline when **Box** is on. Cell lines follow the screen rule (shown only when the
  plate is hidden; studs mark the grid otherwise). `loadProject()`
  restores all of it, re-loading each embedded photo (async, order preserved) and re-running `removeBg` for
  layers that had it. **There is ONE Open, not a separate Load** (`bLoad`/`#projfile` were removed): the
  Open input accepts photos AND `.mosaic`/`.json`, and `openFile()` dispatches by name/type — a project
  file → `loadProject` (asks `confirm()` before replacing on-screen work), anything image → a new layer.
  Drag-and-drop routes through the same `openFile`. No server, no localStorage — a portable file the
  student keeps (Save-picker + Open-dispatch round-trip verified in-browser).
- **Open project name** shows in the header (centered `#projName`, "Project: <name>") AND the browser tab
  title, via `setProjectName()` — called on Open (`loadProject(text, name)` from the file's name) and on
  Save (the picker's `h.name`, or "Mosaic project" on the download fallback), extension stripped. Studio
  has the same gap (its `.svg` designs); extend the same indicator there once Glen has tested Mosaic's —
  keep the two apps in sync on this.
- **Print is live** (`bChart`, menu-bar 🖨️, labeled "Print"). `printMosaic()` prints the SAME WYSIWYG
  picture as Save image: `mosaicImageCanvas(true)` (opaque, so it prints on white paper) → a PNG data URL
  set on a hidden `#printArea` `<img>` → `window.print()`. An `@media print` block hides every body child
  except `#printArea` (id specificity beats `body>*`), so ONLY the mosaic prints; it honors the Show
  checkboxes, so Grid on gives a printable build chart with coordinates. Enabled only when a mosaic is
  built. A repeat print reuses the already-loaded image (guards against the img `load` event not re-firing
  on an identical `src`). Do NOT revert this to a "chart + BOM" placeholder; a parts-list page can be added
  later as a second print section. **The sheet carries its own margin** (`#printArea{padding:8mm}` with
  `@page{margin:4mm}`, since .97): Chrome's print dialog remembers a Margins choice, and at None the
  coordinate strip sat on the paper's edge where no printer lays ink - Glen's print lost half of every row
  letter and column number. Measured with headless Chrome: Default = 12 mm in (as before), None = 8 mm.
  Do not move the safe margin back into `@page` alone; the dialog can zero that.
- **SETTINGS OPENS AS A PANEL UNDER THE GEAR, the way Sangala Studio does it** (Glen, 2026-09-13:
  "the settings option in studio brings up a window; this protocol was not followed in mosaic. since
  studio was first, subsequent tools should follow the precedent set"). `#setup` is a top-level
  `position:fixed` `.panel` (272 px, the same width Studio uses), positioned under `#bSettings` by
  `openSettings()` and dismissed by the gear again, or by a click anywhere outside it EXCEPT the canvas -
  so moving the grid or clicking a tile never closes it. It holds Grid Controls, Baseplate and Medium.
  **A SETTING ONLY - never a control** (Glen, same day, on finding *Fit to Photo* in there): a button that
  DOES something to the design belongs in `#build` beside Build It!, so `#bFitGrid` sits under the status
  line. The gear holds what the design is made of and how it is drawn; the panel holds what you do to it.
  It used to fold open INSIDE `#build`, which pushed the palette down the column; do not put it back.
  **Sangala Blocks still folds its Workspace setup open inside its panel** - the same divergence, not
  yet changed.
- Test material in `images/`: `Crested Crane.png`, `African Buffalo (LEGO).jpg`, the crane/buffalo
  reference mosaics, `Samweli Wanda.png`.
- **Paint / Pick / Erase are live** (left rail). After Build, the **Paint** tool hand-edits the mosaic:
  click or drag cells to set them to the current paint color; **right-click erases** a cell to empty.
  **Erase** (🧽) is the discoverable version of that — left-click or drag clears cells back to empty
  (the baseplate shows through). In paint/erase mode a swatch click *selects* the paint color (and
  owns it, switching to Paint) instead of toggling ownership; the current color shows a blue ring
  (`.sw.cur`). **Pick** samples a cell's color then switches to Paint. Cell writes are incremental into
  `built.counts` (BOM updates on mouseup). `activeTool` = select|paint|pick|erase.
- **Undo / redo** for hand edits: **Ctrl+Z** undoes, **Ctrl+Y** or **Ctrl+Shift+Z** redoes. One stroke
  (a mousedown→mouseup drag, however many cells) is one step — the accidental-line case reverts in a
  single press. Implementation: `curStroke` is a Map of `{before,after}` per touched cell, committed to
  `undoStack` on mouseup (`commitStroke`); `undo`/`redo` replay net per-cell values via `setCell` while
  `curStroke` is null (so they don't re-record). A fresh Build or any composite edit clears the history
  (`clearHistory` in `build()`/`invalidate()`), since those discard hand edits anyway.
  Rebuilding or editing the composite discards hand edits (expected).
- The auto-conversion gets ~80% toward the hand-built "gold standard"; Paint is the last-mile finish.
- **Next candidates:** owned-tile *quantities* (cap a colour, overflow to next-nearest); Print chart
  (numbered chart + parts list); porting Studio's ML background removal (u2netp) for busy
  backgrounds; optional dither. The left rail's disabled **Photo** and **Frame** tools were removed
  (2026-07-24) — redundant with direct manipulation (Open/drag adds photos; drag the frame to move it)
  and modal, against the modeless design. The rail is now purely the post-build hand-edit tools
  (Paint · Pick · Erase).
