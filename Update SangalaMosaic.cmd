REM ==========================================================================
REM  Update Sangala Mosaic to the latest version from GitHub.
REM  Double-click this file. No admin, no install, no git needed.
REM
REM  Sangala Mosaic is a single page -- SangalaMosaic.html -- so this replaces
REM  just that one file (and fetches the turaco icon it uses on the Desktop
REM  shortcut, if it is missing).
REM
REM  It only downloads when there is actually a newer version, and it never
REM  leaves you half-updated: if the page does not download completely, nothing
REM  on your computer is changed.
REM
REM  It also puts a "Sangala Mosaic" icon on your Desktop -- and refreshes it if
REM  you have moved this folder -- whether or not there was anything new. If you
REM  only have this .cmd, running it once installs the whole program.

:shortcut
REM  Put (or refresh) a "Sangala Mosaic" icon on the Desktop that opens the page
REM  in THIS folder with the turaco icon -- so it keeps working after an update
REM  and is corrected if the folder has been moved. Convenience only: it writes
REM  only to the user's own Desktop, and never changes the update's exit code.
REM  Paths travel as environment variables so spaces/apostrophes cannot break the
REM  quoting, and SpecialFolders finds the real Desktop even under OneDrive.
