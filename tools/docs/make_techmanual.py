"""Sangala Mosaic Technical Manual, Ver 1.0 - the script the document is built from.

Formatting comes from Sangala Studio's makedocx, imported rather than copied, so the three

d.body("The repository is obtained from GitHub:", before_list=True)
d.code("https://github.com/maketolearn/SangalaMosaic")
d.body("The application is the single file SangalaMosaic.html, which runs by being opened in a "
       "browser. Two conveniences travel with it. Create Desktop Shortcut.cmd puts a turaco icon on "
       "the Desktop that opens the page, and Update SangalaMosaic.cmd fetches the current version "
       "from GitHub, checks that what arrived is a complete page, and swaps it in only when the "
       "version differs — keeping the previous copy as a backup. Running the updater on its own is "
       "enough to install the application, since it will fetch the page and the icon and then make "
       "the shortcut.")
d.body("A small launcher program, built once from SangalaMosaicLauncher.cs, is offered for managed "
       "Windows computers, which block a .cmd file but run a compiled program.")

d.heading("2. What Sangala Mosaic Is, and the Rule That Shapes It")
d.body("Sangala Mosaic turns a photograph into a mosaic of 1 x 1 LEGO tiles that a person builds by "
       "hand on a baseplate. A photograph is placed under a grid, the grid is framed over the part "
       "that matters, and each cell of the grid becomes one tile in one of the colors the palette "
       "holds. The application produces a picture to build from and a list of the tiles it takes.")
d.body("ONE CONSTRAINT SHAPES THE CODE: the application drives nothing. Sangala Studio carries a "
       "local bridge because it operates a die cutter; Sangala Blocks carries one because it runs a "
       "renderer. Mosaic outputs a chart and a list that a person follows, so it is a single "
       "self-contained HTML file — no server, no bridge, no installation, and it works offline. Do "
       "not add a bridge. If something must be printed, it prints from the browser.")
d.body("A SECOND RULE GOVERNS THE WORDING RATHER THAN THE CODE. The palette is the set of colors the "
       "mosaic uses. Matching it to the tiles a builder owns is one way to work, never the frame: a "
       "student may design first and obtain tiles afterward. Interface text and documentation stay "
       "neutral on that point, and the parts list is the list to order from or build against.")

d.item("The Canvas. ", "A live compositor rather than a series of views. Photographs, the grid and "

                       "time.")
d.item("The Launcher. ", "SangalaMosaic.exe, compiled from a few lines of C#, which does nothing but "

d.body("THE WORKSPACE IS MODELESS, by decision rather than by accident. There is no photograph mode, "
       "no mosaic mode and no compare view; earlier versions had them and they were removed. One "
       "canvas always shows the photographs, the grid over them, and — once built — the mosaic drawn "
       "inside the grid. Comparing a mosaic with its source is done by dragging the photograph "
       "alongside it.")

d.heading("6. The Browser Interface")
d.body("Four regions, carrying the family's names: the menu bar across the top, the Toolbar down the "
       "left, the workspace, and the control panel down the right. The look is shared with Sangala "
       "Studio by copying rather than by a live dependency — the style classes were lifted across "
       "deliberately, and a change to one application's appearance is made in both.")
d.body("The workspace is pinned to the viewport and the control panel scrolls within itself, so the "
       "page never scrolls as a whole. The canvas is rendered at the device's own pixel ratio, so "

                         "its native size, scaled down only if it will not fit, and never scaled up. "
                         "Dragging the body moves it; dragging a corner resizes it with the aspect "

d.item("The Frame. ", "The grid region: a movable, resizable frame whose aspect ratio is locked to "
                      "the grid so cells stay square. It carries the cell lines and the coordinate "
                      "labels — numbers across the top, letters down the side — drawn just outside "
                      "it. Whatever falls inside the frame becomes the mosaic.")
d.body("Background removal is a per-image toggle. It floods in from the corners, feathers the edge "
       "and decontaminates the fringe, and it produces a SEPARATE drawing source rather than "
       "replacing the photograph, so the original is never lost and the toggle is reversible.")

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- 8
d.heading("8. The Palette and the Baseplate")
d.body("The palette holds 43 real LEGO tile colors, each with a name and an RGB value taken from the "
       "manufactured color rather than chosen by eye, and a flag recording whether the builder has "
       "it. The baseplate is chosen from eight colors LEGO actually makes baseplates in, so the "
       "preview shows something that can exist.")
d.body("ONE RULE ABOUT THE PALETTE IS ABSOLUTE: NEW COLORS ARE APPENDED AT THE END. A saved .mosaic "
       "file records each cell as an index into this array, so inserting a color in the middle or "
       "reordering the list silently recolors every mosaic ever saved. Appending cannot do that.")
d.body("The built mosaic is drawn on a studded baseplate, with each tile raised above it by a bevel, "
       "a shadow and a seam, so a tile reads as placed rather than painted. Empty cells show the "
       "bare plate. The plate is cached and redrawn only when it changes, since it is the most "
       "expensive thing on the canvas.")

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- 9
d.heading("9. How a Mosaic Is Built")
d.body("Build It! is the centerpiece, and it runs a pipeline rather than a filter. Each stage exists "
       "because the stage before it is not enough:", before_list=True)
d.step("The framed composite is sampled to an offscreen canvas with image smoothing turned OFF, "
       "eight samples to a cell.")
d.step("Each cell AVERAGES its non-background samples, which flattens the texture that feathering "
       "and photographic noise leave behind.")
d.step("Those averages are clustered by k-means into the number of colors the Colors control asks "
       "for, and each cluster is snapped to its nearest available tile color. Clustering before "
       "snapping is what makes a textured animal one gray rather than five.")
d.step("Two gentle cleanup passes fill pinholes, drop lone strays and recolor outvoted speckle. They "
       "are deliberately conservative, so that a leg one tile wide survives.")
d.body("The result fills the bill of materials — the count of each color, totaling the tiled cells. "
       "Changing any option remaps immediately once a mosaic exists.")
d.body("THE MOSAIC IS A SNAPSHOT, AND ONLY BUILD IT! MAKES ONE. Moving or resizing the grid or a "
       "photograph, adding or deleting images, toggling background removal or a tile color: none of "
       "these disturb an existing mosaic. Only a change to the grid's cell count discards it, "
       "because the mosaic no longer has the same number of cells to occupy. That rule is what "
       "allows everything on the canvas to stay draggable after a build.")

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- 10
d.heading("10. Hand Editing")
d.body("Automatic conversion gets most of the way; faces and eyes are placed by hand. Three tools in "
       "the Toolbar work on a built mosaic: Paint sets cells to the current color by click or drag "
       "and clears them on a right-click, Erase clears them back to bare plate, and Pick samples a "
       "cell's color and switches to Paint.")
d.body("UNDO IS BY STROKE, NOT BY CELL. One press-drag-release is one step, however many cells it "
       "crossed, so an accidental line across the mosaic is reverted by a single Ctrl-Z rather than "
       "forty. Each stroke accumulates the before and after value of every cell it touches and is "
       "committed as one entry when the button is released; undo and redo replay the net value per "
       "cell without re-recording themselves. A fresh build clears the history, because it discards "
       "the hand edits the history refers to.")

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- 11
d.heading("11. The Project File")
d.body("A .mosaic file is JSON and is SELF-CONTAINED: each photograph is embedded in it as a PNG "
       "data URL, alongside the frame, the grid size, the built mosaic with its cell indices and "
       "counts, which colors are owned, the baseplate, the visibility checkboxes, the options and "
       "the paint color. A student can carry one file between computers and lose nothing.")
d.body("Opening one restores all of it, reloading each embedded photograph in order and re-running "
       "background removal for the layers that had it. There is ONE Open rather than a separate "
       "Load: the file input accepts photographs and project files alike and dispatches on what "
       "arrives, and drag-and-drop goes through the same path. Opening a project asks before "
       "replacing work on screen.")
d.body("Saving uses the browser's native Save dialog, so the person chooses the folder and the name. "
       "A plain download is the fallback only where that dialog does not exist. It is not to be "
       "reverted to a download: writing files to the Downloads folder without asking was a defect, "
       "not a shortcut.")

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- 12
d.heading("12. What the Application Writes")
d.body("Everything is reached from the one Save menu, which offers the project and the image, with "
       "the image disabled until a mosaic exists. Print is beside it in the menu bar.")
d.body("THE PICTURE IS WHAT THE SCREEN SHOWS. The saved image and the printed page are produced by "
       "the same offscreen render, and both honor the three visibility checkboxes: the baseplate if "
       "it is shown, the tiles, the cell lines and coordinate labels when the grid is on, and the "
       "outline when the box is on. Grid on therefore yields a printable build chart with "
       "coordinates a student can follow away from the computer. With the baseplate hidden the image "
       "is written with a transparent background.")
d.body("Printing sets that same picture into a hidden element and calls the browser's print, with a "
       "print stylesheet that hides everything else on the page — so what prints is the mosaic and "
       "nothing around it.")

                                        "by nothing else. A change that widens that set takes work "
